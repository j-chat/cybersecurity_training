* [Immersive Labs Digital Cyber Academies](https://www.immersivelabs.com/digital-cyber-academies/): I have only tried the Digital Student Academy. They provide a platform to upskill in cyber security and IT, and testing your response through simulated threats and senarios. There are no required setup and their virtual machines are easily accessible by a browser. Remember to extend the time if needed.

It provides a free environment to practice using Splunk. Sign-up is required each time to access this application.
* [SQLZoo SQL Injection](https://zh.sqlzoo.net/hack/): This site gives SQL statement examples and a safe environment to practice various SQL injections.
* [Try Hack Me](https://www.tryhackme.com): Try Hack Me provides practical cybersecurity training with little setup. An OpenVPN client is required to access their virtual machines and complete the tasks in the rooms.
